I am a beginner in dress making and their patterns are very easy to follow. They gave me another free pattern of that flower backless blouse. I am still going to purchase more. The seller is very helpful. An absolute miracle worker because I just sent them a photo and they know what to do already. They given tested it on a lower scale💕You guys are awesome. Stay open and more power. Will order more patterns. PS i just posted a trial fabric and I cannot post my wedding dress yet because it’s secret🤣😂",
